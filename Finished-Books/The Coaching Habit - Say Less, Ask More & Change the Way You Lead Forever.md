# The Coaching Habit - Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever

## You Need a Coaching Habit

- Coaching is only difficult if you don’t make a habit out of it
- Making a coaching habit can be difficult if you don’t have the right tools and mindset to do so. 
- There are three rings that plague a workplace that coaching habits can resolve.
  - 1. Your people become over dependent on you because you just solve all of their problems, and feed them answers. 
       - Coaching habit helps with this by allowing yourself the opportunity to develop autonomy in those around you, by improving their confidence and direction. 
    2. You become overwhelmed by all of the work you have, and when you’re overwhelmed, you lose focus on the important things, the things that make the most impact. 
       - Coaching habit helps with this by allowing you and your team to set time aside and re-focus on the work that matters, so you can direct your time and energy toward getting the resources to accomplish those tasks
    3. You can feel disconnected from the work that matters. 
       - If your team isn’t doing work that has real purpose, they will become disengaged, and will do less great work. 
       - Coaching habits allow you and your team to focus on the impactful work, help them build the courage to step out of their comfort zone, and learn from their experiences, and fulfil their potential.



## How to Build a Habit

- According to neuroscience, there are 5 essential components to developing a new habit
  - Making a vow
    - Get a clear idea of what the payoff of committing to the habit is
    - Center the habit’s reasoning for serving others, as this might make the habit more impactful
  - Figuring your trigger
    - You first have to identify the trigger for your bad habit before you can hope to change/eliminate it.
    - The more specific you are about defining your trigger, the more effective the change will be
  - “Double-S It” - Short and Simple
    - When starting a habit, make sure the action can be done within a 60 second timespan
    - This part is about identifying the first step or two toward the larger habit
  - Practice Deeply
    - Repeat the process, over, and over, and over… and over again. 
    - Practice small chunks of the big action
    - Celebrate your victories, and acknowledge your downfalls
  - Plan on How to get Back on Track
    - We’re all going to fail at our new habit from time to time. That’s perfectly fine. 
    - We must establish a plan for what we do when we drop the ball. 
- The “New Habit Formula”
  - Identify your trigger
    - There are five primary things that contribute to a trigger
      - Location
      - Time
      - State of Mind (emotions)
      - Other People
      - Immediately preceding events
    - You should use a combination of these when defining your triggers
  - Identifying your old habit
    - You must articulate (in as specific as possible of a frame) what your old habit was so you can identify what you’re trying to change
  - Defining your new behavior
    - Again, being as specific as possible, identify what you will do instead of your old habit, and start by making sure it can be accomplished in less than 60 seconds.

## Question Masterclass Part 1: Ask One Question at a Time

- Asking more than one question at a time can cause the conversation to feel more like an interrogation than a conversation. 
- New proposed habit: 
  - After asking a question (trigger), instead of asking another question, and maybe another (old habit), I will wait for the other person to answer, and genuinely and entirely listen to everything they say before presenting a follow-up question (New habit).

## The Kickstart Question

- It can be difficult to get started in a conversation, especially one of coaching nature. 
- One of these three scenarios could be playing out causing the conversations to never feel useful, or boring: 
  - The small talk tango: Small talk is useful for reconnecting, but rarely leads to a smooth transition into an important conversation. 
  - The Ossified Agenda: You’re only meeting because it’s routine - you’re going over the process (which was important when the meeting series started), instead of what matters
  - The Default Diagnosis: One or both of you assume that you know the issue at hand and start talking about this assumed issue, which could very well be the wrong issue.
- A very effective way to jump start a conversation that is more likely to result in a meaningful conversation is by asking “What’s on your mind?”
  - It allows you to get to what really matters, and it’s just open enough to give that person the autonomy of choosing the topic, but not so open that they could say any random assortment of things that are irrelevant. 
- Two types of coaching: 
  - Coaching for performance - focuses on the issues at hand, and putting out fires. These are everyday things.
  - Coaching for development - focuses not on the issues at hand, but more on the person putting out the fires. This is all about calling them forward to learn, improve, and grow. 
- The 3P method helps identify what is at the heart of a challenge for a person 
  - Projects
    - Projects are the content of a situation. We are generally most familiar with these, as most of our work and the challenges we solve are revolved around this solution. 
    - This is where most of the coaching for performance occurs
    - By starting here, we can identify if this is the problem area, or if we need to address one of the other 2 P’s.
  - People
    - When you’re talking about people, you’re actually talking about a relationship. 
    - More specifically, what your role is in the relationship that could be currently less than ideal. 
  - Patterns
    - Here is the area where you’re addressing patterns in behavior or ways of working that you’d like to change. 
    - This is where most of the coaching for development occurs.



----

- New Habit: 
  - When I begin a conversation with someone with the intent to coach someone, instead of asking about what I perceive as the issue right from the get go, I will get a better understanding of what they’re thinking about by asking “What’s on your mind”

---

## Question Masterclass Part 2: Cut the Intro and Ask The Question

- Framing a question with an introduction, some fluff, and then asking the question only distracts the person from the question at hand. 
- If you know what you want to ask, then ask the question. 
- If you want to make the question easier to handle and less blunt, then start it with something short like “Out of curiosity…”. 

---

New Habit

- When I am asking a question… instead of framing the question, giving it background, explaining why I’m asking it, etcetera… I will just cut to the question at hand, and then shut up as it’s being answered.

---

## The AWE Question

- ==The AWE Question - **<u>A</u>**nd **<u>W</u>**hat **<u>E</u>**lse?==

- There are three reasons it has the impact that it does
  - More options can lead to better decisions
    - The first answer given is almost never the only answer, and it’s very rarely the best answer
    - When presented with more options than just two - studies show our rate for success is dramatically increased. 
    - You’ll get more (and often better) options, better options means better decisions. Better decisions means more success. 
  - Helps you reign it in
    - We’re driven by the need for clarity, and so we tend to offer advice whenever we can. 
    - This advice is rarely the right advice when given on impulse. 
    - By asking “And What Else?”, it allows you to break the habit of emitting your advice, and listen more. 
  - Buys you some time
- Four tips for asking “And what else?”
  - Stay genuine, and curious. 
    - Don’t just ask “And what else?” and then not stick around for the answer. Ask because you care, and you want to know the answer. 
    - You don’t always have to use the words “And what else?”, you can mix it up a bit. 
  - Ask it more often
    - You are not restricted to one “and what else?”. You can use it a couple times, maybe even three. 
  - Recognize Success
    - When you ask the question and get “there is nothing else”, then that is a successful moment - it means you’ve achieved what you were going for. 
    - Move on to another question. 
  - Wrapping it up
    - Asking “Is there anything else?” is a good version of “And what else?” that presents the idea of closure, but still offers them another chance to speak up about something. 
- “And what else?” Creates more options - but you can have too many options
  - Neuroscience points to four being the magic number of options we can enjoy having. Too many beyond that, and we likely go into decision paralysis. 
  - Ask “And What Else?” to get a few options on the table - not a dozen… but also not two. 



---

New Habit

- When I ask someone an open question and they respond with a solution, instead of just going with their first solution, or even worse, ignoring it and offering my own solution, I will simply ask some variation of “And when else?” to get them to think more about the problem at hand. 

---





## Question Masterclass Part 3: Should you Ask Rhetorical Questions?

- Stop giving advice with a question mark attached to it…
  - Have you thought of… 
  - What about…? 
- These may seem clever, but they’re not. They’re simply advice offered in a question format. 
- Ask “And What Else?” type questions and you should find the other person is able to come to your conclusion themselves… which will make that solution feel so much better to them…

## The Focus Question

- All too often when presented with a situation, we take the first “presenting challenge”, and we jump the gun and start working on that as the problem. 
  - This very well could be not the problem at all… but it’s something you want to solve.

- When someone comes to you with a problem, what they’re laying out for you very well may not be the real problem at hand.
- Three things could occur by giving into this instinctual impulse: 
  - You could be focusing on the wrong problem. 
    - Because you didn’t dig further into the situation presented, you just started working on the first thing that represented an issue. But it may not be THE issue.
  - You could end up solving the problem yourself
    - Because you know the solution, people may come to you to solve the issue instead of them doing it. This leads to them being dependent on you. 
  - The problem could never get solved
    - Because you have other things to do, but you know the solution, you may end up being asked about it, and never follow up with it. 
- By slowing down, and asking the right question, you can avoid all of this.
- “What’s the real challenge here for you?”
  - “What’s the real challenge” makes the person acknowledge the various levels to a situation or an issue, and identify the main issue that needs to be solved. 
  - “here for you?” makes sure the person doesn’t disassociate themselves from the issue, and makes them think about what they specifically are struggling with. 
- How the focus question helps in various situations (or “Foggy-fiers”)
  - Proliferation of Challenges
    - Occurs when asking someone the kickstart question of “What’s on your mind?” and they list out a slew of problems they’re having. You could be presented with 5, 6, or 10 problems they’re having if you let them go on for long enough. 
    - By asking something like “If you were choose one of those issues to focus on, which one seems to be the real challenge for you?”, you resist the urge to solve any one particular problem, and allow them to prioritize what they need help with. 
  - Coaching the ghost
    - Occurs when you’re coaching someone and it turns into them talking about another person/project/event and not so much their problems with that thing. 
    - By asking something like “I think I understand some of your problems with [thing], what seems to be the real challenge here for you when dealing with [thing]”, you bring the focus back to the person you’re coaching, and not talking about the thing the entire time. 
- By adding the “for you” at the end of the question, you target the question toward the person, and what they can do. This is key to having those “Coaching for Development” sessions (Coaching for development focuses on the person putting out the fire, as opposed to the fire itself).

----

New Habit

- When someone comes to me with problems, or a conversation is jumping straight to solutions, instead of trying to solve the first problem or the most comfortable problem, I will slow down and ask some variation of “What is the real problem here for you/us?”

---



## Question Masterclass Part 4: Stick to questions starting with “What”

- Questions that start with “why” can very easily put people on the defensive. 
- Get the tone if the “why” slightly wrong, and the way your question is perceived very quickly goes from “Why did you…” to “What the hell were you thinking?!”
- You ask “Why” to get more details. You want to get more details to solve a problem. Your job is not to solve the problem.
  - If you’re not trying to fix something, you don’t need the backstory.

---

New Habit

- When I’m about to ask someone a question that starts with “why”, instead of asking the “why” question, find a way to rephrase the question as a “what” question. 
  - “Why did you do that?” -> “What were you hoping for here?”
  - “Why did you think this was a good idea?” -> “What made you choose this course of action”
  - “Why are you bothering with this?” -> “What’s important for you here?”

## An Irresistible 1-2-3 combination

- The first three big questions provided are very powerful, and can become a very robust way of going through your coaching conversations

Open with “What’s on your mind?”

Check in: “Is there anything else on your mind?”

Then Begin to focus: “What’s the real challenge here for you?”

Look for more Problems: “And what else is the real challenge here for you?”

Probe again: “Is there anything else?”

Now that you have the main issues in front of you: “Which of these are THE real problem here for you?”

## The Foundation Question

- “What do you want?”
  - This is a hard question for people to answer, because sometimes they don’t know what they really want.
- Asking for what we want is nerve racking, and we often make excuses for not asking for what we want. 
  - We often fear the other person saying “No”, “Maybe”, “Not that, but this instead” in response. 
  - You must represent your wants, while understanding that the other person is allowed to say “No”. 
    - On the flip side, you as the person being asked for something that they want, need to understand that it is perfectly acceptable to say “No”, “Maybe”, or “Not that, but this instead”…
- In order to have a truly level conversation, two people have to know what the other person wants. So when you ask the other person what they want, offer a little insight into what you want. 
- 5 times a second, our brain scans our environment and determines based on various factors “Is it safe? Or not?”
  - If it is safe, then you’re more at ease, your brain can focus and perform at 100%. 
  - If it feels unsafe, then you’re a lot less focused on a problem, and more so on your fight or flight reaction. 
- A large part of what determines your brains decision on whether or not it’s safe can be explained with the acronym “TERA”
  - Tribe - Are you with me or against me? Are you on my side? 
  - Expectation - Do I know what the near future is like, or is it unpredictable? 
  - Rank - Are you more or less important than I am in the current moment (Not in a sense of titles, but overall power)
  - Autonomy - Do I get a say, or don’t I? Do have a say in what happens in this environment. 
- By asking “What do you want?”, you increase their Tribe factor by showing them you’re on their side, as you’re helping them solve a problem instead of telling them what to do, their Rank factor because you are “giving them the floor”, and their autonomy factor by literally giving them the say in the situation. 

---

New Habit

- When I feel the conversation is starting to lose focus on an objective, or the conversation started but isn’t going anwhere, instead of assuming what someone wants without asking them, I will ask them “What do you want?” to give them the floor and determine where the conversation goes. 

---

## Question Masterclass Part 5: Get Comfortable with Silence

- Silence just means that the other person is thinking about their answer. This is a good thing. 
- There is no need to rephrase your question, or ask a different question all together yet. give them Space

## The Lazy Question

- The drama triangle describes three archetypes that we tend to assume in different scenarios. 
  - Each have their own downsides, and no one is inherently one of them. 
  - **Victim** - “My life is not good, my life is unfair, and I have no control over this. It’s not my fault, it’s theirs”
  - **Persecutor** - “I’m surround by fools/idiots/people are less good than me. It’s not my fault, it’s your fault.”
  - **Rescuer** - “Don’t worry or fight the issue. I will jump in and take care of it for you. It’s not your fault/responsibility, it’s mine.”
- Going around the drama triangle, from one role to another, is very common, and it will happen very quickly sometimes. 
  - Being able to identify your triggers for when you fall into the drama triangle, you can better and more quickly get yourself out. 
- “How can I help?” is a question that can help you get out of the drama triangle quicker and look at the situation outside of the three roles in the triangle.
  - The question is very useful for two reasons: 
    1. It helps the other person have to deliberately think about their specific request, and specify one thing. 
    2. It helps you be “lazy” and not jump into action thinking you know exactly what they need help with or trying to play rescuer and take things over. 
- “What do you want from me?” is a more blunt version of “How can I help?”, but with the bluntness, you run the risk of the question coming off as aggressive. 
  - Using “Out of curiosity…” or “Just so we’re on the same page…” can help ease the bluntness of the question. 
- There’s a certain level of anxiety about asking someone how you can help..
  - What if they ask you to do some crazy hard/time consuming/inconvenient task? 
- With asking how you can help, and the other person describing a way you can help, you ARE NOT obligated to say yes. 
  - You can say… “Yes”, “No”, “I can’t do that but I can do…”, “I’m not sure about that, let me check some things out first.” or any other response. You’re not forced to say yes. 
- The goal of this question is not to never give advice or help out. It is to postpone and delay your immediate desire to react and help out/take over. 

---

New Habit

- Whenever someone asks me a question that makes me want to jump into hero mode and take over, instead of jumping in and giving advice/do it for them, I will instead ask something close to “How can I help with this?” to make sure that my help is desired, and also so that I know that we’re in alignment with what the real problem is.

---

## Question Masterclass Part 6: Actually Listen to the Answer

- Make sure that after you ask a question, you don’t just play the active listener role, but you ARE actually actively listening. 
  - Shooing any distractions away, and honing in on what they’re saying right then and there.

## The Strategic Question

- It’s very common for people to “brag” about being busy, because it means they have a lot of work to do. 
  - Being busy is not necessarily a good thing. 
- The word “strategy” is a word associated with anything that we want to seem important or smart. 
  - One of the meanings of strategy is: “Strategy is determining what not to do.”
- “If you say yes to this, what are you saying No to?”
  - Really helps frame what is being asked of a person, and forces the person to consider the tradeoffs (because there are some) to saying yes. 
    - If there weren’t tradeoffs, then we’d all be able to do everything we ever said we’d do. 
  - The tradeoff of saying yes to doing something is that you have to say no to other things. There are two types of No’s. 
    - No by omission - the things that you are immediately and implicitly saying no to by agreeing to doing something.
      - “By saying yes to this meeting, I’m immediately saying no to anything that is occurring at the same time.”
    - No by commission - the things you will have to say no to in order to truly and honestly be able to say Yes to something. 
      - In order to think about these things, you can use the 3P’s again: 
        - Projects
          - What projects do you need to abandon or postpone?
          - What meetings will you no longer attend? 
          - What resources do you need to divert to the Yes? 
        - People
          - What expectations do you need to manage?
          - From what Drama Triangle dynamics will you extract yourself?
          - What relationships will you let wither?
        - Patterns
          - What habits do you need to break? 
          - What old stories or dated ambitions do you need to update?
          - What beliefs about yourself do you need to let go of?
- In order to be able to say no, you first need to be able to say yes more slowly
  - Ask questions about the task being requested of you before you just blindly say yes. - Stay curious before committing
    - “Why are you asking me?”
    - “Whom else have you asked?”
    - “When you say this is urgent, what do you mean by that?”
    - “When does this need to be completed by?”
    - “If, for whatever reason, I couldn’t do all of this, but just a part of it, which part would you want me to do?”
    - “What do you want me to take off my plat so I can do this?”
- Saying no to something is hard and awkward, because you’re actually saying no to someone. 
  - Something that help ease this habit, is to write the request(s) down, and then point to the requests that you’re saying to, and say “I’m afraid I’m going to have to say no to this.”
    - This creates a “Third point of contact” in what was just the thing and the person. 

## Question Masterclass Part 7: Acknowledge the Answers You Get

- Instead of rushing from one question to the next “and what else?” or another question, first acknowledge their answer/response with your own affirmations
  - “Nice”
  - “I like it.”
  - “Good one.”
  - “Yes, that’s good.”
- Tack these affirmations on before asking your next question
  - “Very good, and what else can we do to address this?”

## The Learning Question

- We really learn after we take a second to reflect on what just happened. 
  - “Double looped learning”
    - If the first loop was the doing of the action, the second loop is creating a learning moment.
- ==“What was most useful for you?”== provides a perfect environment for that second loop to take place. 
- There are four main drivers for long term memory, creating the acronym “AGES”
  - **A**ttention
  - **G**eneration - The act of creating connections to new ideas
    - This is why giving advice is bad for long term growth. If we have to find the answers ourselves rather than be told or read something, we are much more likely to remember the answer.
      - Ask questions to let them get to the conclusion.  
  - **E**motion
  - **S**pacing
- “What was the most useful for you?” is powerful in a few ways: 
  - It assumes the conversation was useful, and then creates a moment for you to reflect on what that use was.
  - If multiple things were discussed, it has the other person pick out one or two of the big ticket items - the things that should definitely be remembered in the end.
  - By adding “For you” at the end of the question, you make it personal. You make them tell themselves what was useful, rather than you telling them what should have been useful.
  - It gives you feedback as well if you listen to what they say. It could give you insight on what you’re doing that you should do more of, etc. 
  - It forces the person to answer the question after extracting the value out of a conversation. They’re learning from it. 
    - This is better than the “Was this useful to you?” question which sets up for a simple yes/no answer. 
  - It reminds people how useful you are to them. 
    - If at the end of every feedback session, they were to think back through the conversation and pick out useful bits, then every session provided SOME use. (and if not, then all future ones should).

## Question Masterclass Part 8: Use Every Channel to Ask a Question

- Asking the 7 core questions works in all channels - email, IM, Teams, etcetera. 
- All of the triggers for the bad habits can easily be applied to email communication as well.
