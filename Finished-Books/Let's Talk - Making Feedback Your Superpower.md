# Let’s Talk - Making Feedback Your Superpower

## Introduction

- Giving feedback is difficult
- A good portion of managers avoid giving any critical feedback because it's so difficult. 
- The difficulty lies in the fact that you're dealing with a person - often one that you know. 
- Giving good feedback could not only lead to that person respecting you more, but might provide that person with the right attitude and desire to fix and improve themselves. 
- Giving feedback is not only about talking. It is a two way street - you have to listen as well. 
  - 56% of people said that their worst feedback session would have been a lot better had the feedback giver listened to their side. 
- Giving feedback is something that should be done frequently, and the newer generations expect it. 
- There are various feedback structures and philosophies out there already
  - Radical Transparency - Letting someone know up front what their issues are without holding anything back
    - Some people react well to this - but not many. Too aggressive
  - Radical Candor - "Challenge Directly - Care Personally"
    - Requires a very high level of emotional intelligence to be executed correctly
  - Focus on strengths - not on faults
  - Ill-equips someone to handle conversations when things need to be said about poor actions taken. 

- “Keep doing what you're doing" is not feedback - it's avoiding feedback.

## Part 1: Moving from a Script to a Real Conversation

### Chapter 1 - Three Kinds of Feedback: Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation

- Appreciation, coaching, and evaluation
  - Appreciation lets someone know what they did really well, but also that the work they did was noticed and appreciated - further more, that they themselves are noticed, and appreciated. 
  - Coaching - Letting someone be aware of things that they could do or be aware of to improve
  - Evaluation - Letting someone understand where they stand in the moment - or how well they’re doing. 
- ==All three types of feedback are required, for all people - top performer or not==. 
- Sometimes the feedback you think someone wants or needs, is not the feedback they were looking for. 
  - ==In the event that feedback is requested, try asking them what they’re looking for in order to give the best feedback experience==
- Timing matters
  - Appreciation and coaching are best to give within a short time span of what the feedback is referring to.
    - The target of the feedback is a lot fresher in their minds, so it will have a greater impact. 
- ==Base the approach of giving feedback based on how experienced they are in what you’re giving feedback on==. 
  - If they’re in an expert at what they do and in their career, but just delivered a publish speech for the first time - start with appreciation. 
    - If they’ve given speeches a number of time, they might not need as much appreciation shown as coaching on how to improve. 
  - Appreciation when new to something is essential to not encouraging giving up to inadequacy. 
- There is a difference between coaching and evaluation - be sure to be clear about which one you’re giving. 
  - “First I want to let you know where you stand, then I’d like to go over what I think could be done to see some improvements.”
- It is important not to be an evaluator when the person is looking for a coach. And don’t be a coach when they’re looking for an evaluator. 
  - Coaching is when someone is being open with their downfalls and their ambitions - don’t nail them with an evaluation. 

### Chapter 2 - Side with the Person, Not the Problem

- Three problematic mindsets
  - “The script will save me” mindset
    - Preparing a whole script for your feedback sessions
    - Your memory will fail you, and your focus will be so much on what you’re saying, and what you’re suppose to say next. None of your focus will be on the other person
  - “Siding with the Problem” mindset
    - ==There are three people in the room when addressing a problem==
      - You, the other person, and the problem
    - If you side with the problem, the other person is all by themselves, not feeling heard, or even misrepresented. 
    - Stay neutral so they feel they can explain themselves and allow for more open communication
  - “They’re a little..” mindset
    - This mindset is when you associate the problem as being a part of the other person’s personality. 
    - This means that you develop a fixed mindset, meaning you think that it can’t be changes because the problem, is a part of who they are. 
      - Giving feedback with a fixed mindset is noticed, and not received well. 
    - ==Approach situations with a growth mindset== - one that acknowledges the person can learn how not to continue the undesirable behavior. 
    - Don’t just specify the poor behavior. This makes them feel like you don’t this can get better. 
      - Specify both behavior and situation
    - Someone in the “out-group” to you is especially vulnerable to the preconceived notion that they won’t change.
    - ==You have to believe someone can change, in order for the feedback to be effective.== 
  - You have to be on the other person side - not the problems side. 
    - They still need to be held accountable, but they need to know that they have your support, and you’re looking out for them, and want the best outcome possible for them. 
    - This needs to be established before they’re going to take any real criticism/feedback/coaching on the subject.
    - “That doesn’t seem like my problem” or “It’s that person’s problem” are phrases that can indicate they’re not ready to be coached - also indications that you need to show them you’re on their side. 
  - There are five signs that you aren’t sufficiently focused on the other person
    1. You don’t know the other person’s goals
       - Knowing a person’s goals or what they’re looking to achieve is crucial to showing them that you’re on their side. 
         - This comes with listening to them.
       - If you incorporate their goals with their negative behavior/performance/etc. then it shows you have their best interest in mind, but also that you’re not siding with the problem because you show that you want them to achieve their goals. 
       - “This is a big problem that needs to be fixed” vs. “I know you want to accomplish… and I think one of the things holding you back is…” 
    2. You don’t know what kind of feedback the other person is seeking
       - Understanding the feedback the other person wants to get allows you to make sure they’re engaged when you give that feedback. 
       - If there’s feedback you think they need to hear, then you can hang your feedback on the feedback they are looking for. 
    3. Other people can hear you. 
       - Appreciation can be okay to give where others can hear - IF that’s okay with the recipient - first give appreciation in private, then ask how they feel about public appreciation. 
       - Coaching and Evaluations should ALWAYS be in private, where others cannot hear. 
         - Doing it in a public environment is very embarrassing and will not be received very well, if at all. 
    4. You’re doing all the talking
       - Listen more - talk less. 
    5. You don’t know how the other person sees the situation
       - You have to dedicate time to understanding how the other person sees the problem. 
       - You may think you know what they’re going to say, but hear them out. 
       - This is crucial to making sure that they know you’re on their side, and not attacking them. 

### Chapter 3 - Say Your Good Intentions Out Loud

- ==Superpower Tip #3: Your good intentions will do a lot more good if the other person hears them.== 
- You need to find some way to convey “I want nothing but the best for you”
  - ==You may have said it weeks ago, or think it’s implied, but that’s not good enough.== 
  - Associate your support, with the “bad” news. 
- No one likes the bearer of bad news - we all tend to “shoot the messenger” in some way. 
  - This only makes being the bearer of bad news that much harder.
- People do not blame themselves when receiving bad news - the tend to blame others. 
  - However, when receiving good news, they do not blame anyone, they believe they deserved it. 
  - If you are the bearer of bad news, they will immediately believe that there is some malevolent reason you’re trying to do harm to them. 
- Explicitly stating that you want great things for them, will make their perception of you as the bearer of bad news not as negative as if you didn’t state your good intentions. 
  - They still may not be a fan of the bad news, but they won’t dislike you as much. 
- Having mixed motivations is perfectly fine. 
  - If you’re concerned for your own reputation and the teams reputation, or if you’re concerned for the individuals reputation, but also for yours, that’s also fine. 
  - When you do have mixed intentions, look for the good things you *do* want for that person, and use those as the motivations behind your observations or concern.
- Make sure to identify when stating “I want the best for you” feels natural and when it doesn’t.
  - It may feel more natural in evaluation feedback than it does in coaching.
  - When it feels awkward or unnatural, try expressing that you’re on their side in different ways. 
- ==There are more ways to say that you’re on their side.==
  - ==Tie your feedback to a goal of theirs if you know of them==. 
  - If you’re unaware of the other person’s goals, tying feedback to a worry of theirs can also be quite effective. 
  - If you’re unaware of the other person’s goals or worries, or if neither their goals nor worries are really applicable, there are good blanket statements that can be just as beneficial
    - “I want to see you learn and grow”
    - “I want to see you become the best X you can be.”
    - “I don’t want Y to be a limiter for you”
    - “I don’t want any red flags for you. When other people think of you or talk about you, I want them to say ‘That person is great,’ full stop. I don’t want them to say, ‘That person is great, but…’.”
- If you do offer a tailored good intention - make sure to revisit in some of the future feedback sessions to make sure it doesn’t come off as disingenuous. 

### Chapter 4 - Listen Like Your Job Depends on it

- ==Listening is the key to giving good feedback.== 
  - Effective listening is hard - we speak at 120-150 words per minute, but most can think around 700 words per minute. Focusing on something so “slow” requires effort. 
  - There are different types of speaking, and different mediums to speaking. There are also different types of listening. 
    - “Critical Listening” is listening for lapses in logic, or contradictions. - “Listening for the consistency and accuracy in a speaker’s message.”
    - ==“Relational Listening” is listening with the goal of seeing the other person’s point of view==. 
  - People do not need or want your critical listening when providing feedback - they want your relational listening. They need to feel like you’re hearing them out. 
    - ==If they don’t feel like you’re listening to them, then they think you don’t understand the problem, which mean’s you’re not fit to provide a solution.==

- Listening to someone brings out the best in them. 

  - ==The listener sets the tone==. 
  - If you’re partially listening - or are distracted, then they will be forced to go into “Used car salesman” mode - they will do/say what they can to get your attention, and then when they get it, they will go into highlighting only the important parts. 

  - If you’re solely listening to them, and being a good listener, they will feel comfortable and more at ease that they don’t have to work as hard for your attention, and they will be more open with you. 
  - Someone listening to you and asking you about yourself becomes a person you want to talk to, and are more likely to put effort into talking to. 
    - ==“Show me I’m worth listening to and I’ll become someone worth listening to”==

- A large part of being a great listener is also asking the right questions. 
  - There are two types of questions that are commonly asked - task-focused questions and people-focused questions. 
    - Task-focused questions focus on what needs to get done, what has been done, progress on things, etc. 
      - Task-Focused leaders focus on tasks requirements, creating task structures, and monitoring performance.
    - People-focused questions focus more on the people doing these tasks. You’re asking *about* them, you’re interested *in* them. 
      - People-focused leaders focus on building and maintaining communication channels, attitudes, and relationships that allow groups to work together. 
  - ==Research shows that teams with people-focused leaders tend to learn faster==, and repeat mistakes less than teams with task-focused leaders. 
- ==Validation is a very important part in conversation.== 
  - Validating someone does not mean that you agree with them. It simply means that you show empathy toward how they’re feeling, letting them know that their *feelings are perfectly reasonable*. 
  - Invalidating someone would sound like “No need to get so worked up.” or “You’re overreacting.”
  - Validation is a very important step in providing good coaching feedback - you can provide a solution, but if you don’t validate the other person’s point of view, then they don’t feel understood. 

## Part 2: The Practices

### (Appreciation) Practice 1: Recognize Each Person’s Strengths

- Give appreciation a lot more
  - Giving appreciation more often is a huge motivator for a lot of people. 
  - ==Sometimes high performance leads to appreciation. More often than not though - appreciation leads to high performance.==
  - Make sure the appreciation is well delivered and sincere, otherwise, it will lose it’s touch
    - “Good job” isn’t good enough. 

- Praise to criticism ratio should be around 5:1 

- People may declare that what they want is criticism in order to improve, but in the middle/after a hard day at work, the last thing they need is criticism. 

- ==What people actually crave is recognition of progress.==

  - ==Appreciation should be directed at improvements==
  - You don’t have to (and shouldn’t) wait until they’ve reached their goal to give praise. 
  - Give people praise for making progress toward their goal, or toward completion of a difficult, or long task.

- There is a concept that is called the feedback sandwich. The idea is to start with appreciation, then lay on your criticism, and then finish it with another slice of appreciation. 

  - This method does have some merit. 
  - Starting with criticism right off the bat results in them not listening, disregarding you (and your feedback), and respecting your feedback less. 
  - Starting with (genuinely) appreciating the good work results in a more attentive conversation when addressing the criticism. They will take you and your feedback more seriously, and are more likely to act on it. 
  - The following appreciation in the sandwich has been proven to be irrelevant in terms of effectiveness of feedback session. 

- ==Everyone has “me strengths” and “we strengths”==

  - “We strengths” are things that someone is really good at that provides great value to the team or organization. 
  - “Me Strengths” are things that someone is very passionate about, enjoy doing, and bring great happiness. 
  - “Me Strengths” do not need appreciation as much - ==often being able to do them is good enough for the person.== 
    - Find a way to make sure they take part in this strength regularly to make sure they stay happy with where they’re at.

  - “We strengths” are where praise and appreciation should be focused. 

- Finding ones strengths can usually come down to just asking about what makes them tick. 

  - “Remember a few times where you were so wrapped up in what you were doing that you lost track of time. What were those things?”
  - “What seems to come more easily for you than for others?” or “What have other people told you that you do incredibly well?”

- Some people are easier to praise than others - high performers, or people who are striving for improvement. Some people are more difficult - subpar performers, or those who appear to have a negative attitude. 

  - If someone is subpar but you still want to show them praise, there are things you can do and say. 
    - Remember - ==people find criticism of shortcomings easier to accept if the hard work had been acknowledged.== Focus on this.
    - Once you show appreciation for their hard work, you can ask them what they think of their work.

  - ==Avoid giving false praise== in an attempt to give a subpar performer “Appreciation”. 
    - You set the bar for someone lower than what it’s actually at - giving them the idea that they’re meeting or even exceeding expectations. 
    - They can usually tell that you’re not being sincere. 

  - ==Hard work is not the only thing people like acknowledgement for==: 
    - Going above and beyond
    - Proactive and initiative-taking actions. 
    - Taking responsibility for a problem or a neglected need. 
    - Offering good ideas. 
    - Showing loyalty and commitment. 
    - Promoting teamwork. 

- ==Your appreciation should never be vague.== Be specific - try to name what they did and why that was so important. 

  - This enables and encourages the other person to try to repeat those praised actions. 

  

### (Coaching) Practice 2 : Ask More, Tell Less

- Coaching is not about giving advice and handing out solutions, but instead helping the other person determine a solution. 
  - ==You do not create solutions, you foster them.== 
  - Questions are an excellent tool to help accomplish this.
- First reason to ask more questions: People will have better conversations with you and like you more. 
  - Follow-up questions provide a lot of benefits to the conversation - one of them being that the other person feels that you care. 
- Another (very important) reason for asking questions: to ==get the other persons perspective on an issue.== 
  - ==Ask questions **<u>then</u>** consider giving advice.== 
  - Asking a series of questions so they can outline a few of their challenges is a great way to get perspective. 
    - Finish that series of questions with “which of these is your real challenge for you” is a great way to understand their barriers and priorities. 
- People who feel powerful in a situation are neurologically worse at seeing someone else’s perspective - they actually assume they already know their side. 
  - To add to that fire - giving feedback triggers your brain to feel more powerful. 
- Giving feedback on something you saw is easier than giving it on something you heard about. 
  - In this case, it’s best to let the other person put the issue on the table. 
  - Asking questions is a great way to let them have the opportunity to bring things up, and allows you to get their side before trying to coach them on anything. 
- ==Asking questions helps create “psychological safety” which puts the other person at ease==. 
  - Asking questions that start with “why…” can quickly make the other person defensive and strip them of that safety. 
  - Take a collaborative approach for as long as possible. 
- Using other person’s phrasing and language when recapping/rephrasing can let them feel you’re actually listening.
  - Don’t parrot them though - this makes them feel you are mocking them. 
- Your reward circuit in the brain fires when given a reward or appreciation. It also fires off when you’re moving closer to your goals. 
  - ==It’s important to tie your advice to someone’s goals, making those reward circuits fire off==, making them happy to get the feedback. 
- Giving your advice can be perceived as micromanage-y. More so the less questions you ask. 
  - Telling someone “I would do…” or “I would try…” can lead the other person to feel like they’re cornered into doing that, even if they don’t think it’ll work.
  - ==Using the phrase “I wonder what would happen if…?” opens the conversation into a two way dialogue== where your advice is considered instead of forced. 
    - This enables the other person to be curious about the possibility of the scenario. 
  - Sometimes a collaborative solution finding approach does not work out for a little too long, then telling the person how you would approach the scenarios is appropriate/necessary
    - This should be a last resort.
- If a person needs/wants coaching in an area you have no knowledge of, questions can be your savior. More specifically - ==honest, open ended questions== 
  - You’re not suggesting a particular solution
  - You can’t possibly know the answer the other person will give
  - Your goal is to lead them to an aha moment. 
- Questions are also an excellent tool when dealing with someone who doesn’t like being told to do something. 
  - Questions allow them to make the decision to do something.

### (Coaching) Practice 3: Minimize the Threat

- When someone feels threatened, they go into a defensive state of mind, and their stress levels rise. The increase in stress affects our brains in two big ways
  - It ==drastically reduces our capability to accurately recall events== - and not just ones that happened a month ago, but also those that took place yesterday or even earlier today.
  - An increase in stress also ==reduces your cognitive flexibility== - the ability to look at a situation/solution in depth, and then switch to another situation/solution and look a that one in depth as well. 
    - Someone who is low in cognitive flexibility will be stuck on the first solution that is discussed and will be convinced that is the one to go with even though they may not be able to refute the other solutions. 
- Keep the “SCARF” Method in mind when giving feedback. 
  - The SCARF method outlines five key elements, and says that ==if these elements are out of sync in a negative way, the person will feel threatened, and if they are out of sync in a positive way, they will feel rewarded==. 
    - **S**tatus - Sense of importance relative to their peers
    - **C**ertainty - Clarity about how the future will unfold
    - **A**utonomy - Sense of control over events that are unfolding, now or in the future
    - **R**elatedness - Connection and sense of safety around others - whether you see your colleagues as friends or foes. 
    - **F**airness - Perception of an interaction as just and unbiased
  - If your feedback could decrease status, find a way to boost one of the other four elements first so that things “even out”. 
- A person receiving feedback can either have a fixed or a growth mindset. 
  - A person with a fixed mindset is inclined to believe that someone is either great at something, or they’re not. 
    - This person will be in “proving mode” when given feedback - trying to prove that they are great at that something, and not accepting that maybe they’re not. 
    - Much easier to be threatened by feedback.
  - A person with a growth mindset is inclined to believe that everything can be learned
    - This person will be in “learning mode” when given feedback - accepting that there is room to grow and learn from the criticism. 
- When giving feedback, you should ==always encourage a growth mindset with the feedback you give==. 
  - If someone currently has a fixed mindset about something, then gently suggest that what they’re being given feedback on is something that can be learned, and that few people are ever just born good at it. 
    - “I know this is daunting, but I also know you can learn this. I’ve seen you pick up and learn much harder things in the past, such as …”
    - “No matter how skilled someone is, there’s always huge room for improvement. You’re on the learning curve, and I’m proud of that. You should be too.”
- A very effective method for coaching someone to perform better without threatening them is by ==using the Self Referencing method==. 
  - This method takes an example of the person demonstrating the behavior/skills in the past that you’re pushing for, and uses that as an example when explaining what behavior you’re hoping to see. 
    - “In small groups of people, you command the conversation, you’re outspoken, you’re heard. But when you get into a meeting room, you’re quiet, and nervous. Bringing that energy into the meeting room can greatly benefit how the clients see you, and enhance their confidence in you. So, how can we go about getting the guy from the small group conversations into the meeting rooms?”
  - This method is successful for a number of reasons: 
    - ==You’re not comparing their behavior to someone else’s successes==, which only makes them feel inferior. 
    - You’re comparing their behavior in one setting to another one of their behaviors in a different setting. This proves to them that they are definitely capable of making the improvements. 
    - By being able to give an example, it shows to them that you are in fact paying attention, and care about them. 
- Coaching a personal issue is awkward, but can be done in five steps: 
  - “This is a little awkward to mention… probably for both of us…”
  - Demonstrate good intent
  - State your observation
  - Possible impact on their work or reputation
  - “What are your thoughts?” (And then shut up and listen).

### (Coaching) Practice 4: Accept You’re Biased and be Vigilant

- A conscious bias is the bias that you are aware of, and in particular environments, speak out about
  - Politics, Race, gender, etc.
- An unconscious bias can run counter to our conscious beliefs. These are learned stereotypes that are automatic, unintentional, deeply ingrained, universal and able to influence behavior. 
  - Unconscious biases are typically learned without someone explicitly teaching us. They are biases created by observations within our environment. 
  - You can discover your own unconscious biases by taking an Implicit association Test
    - https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/
- The feedback given to men is generally much more specific, consistent, and helpful than the feedback given to women.
  - Women will receive less consistent feedback than men 
    - ie. On a rating scale, she’ll be given a 3/5 but the written feedback will be “Outstanding work!”. But if a man gets a 3/5 it will be followed with “Need improvement when talking to clients”. 
  - Women’s feedback/praise is inflated, or padded. 
    - When a man gets praised highly for something, everyone knows for a fact that he deserved that praise. But when a female gets the same praise, people are still doubtful of whether she earned that praise. 
- There are four common feedback challenges, or fears, when giving feedback to females
  - How to tell her to speak up
    - If a woman on your team could benefit from speaking up more, don’t simply state “You should speak up more in meetings”. 
      - This advice could just frustrate her because chances are that she 
    - Oxford research has shown that when a man asked the first question, men dominated the rest of the meeting, and a large portion of the women were silent. But when a woman asks the first question, then men and women participated much more equally. 
  - How to tell her she’s too aggressive
    - Women get labeled “aggressive” far more than men - largely because of our unconscious biases that paint women as “gentle”, “compassionate”, etc. so when they speak up for themselves it’s commonly viewed as aggressive. 
    - When a man interrupts to present an idea, he is viewed as assertive and intelligent, when a woman interrupts in the same manner, with the same comment, she is viewed as rude, pushy, and overly-aggressive. 
    - If it is a single person raising a complaint about the person being aggressive, talk to the person that complained
      - “What gives you the impression that she is aggressive?”
      - If that person lists behaviors that commonly displayed across the other team members, mention that so they get an understanding that it’s not just the one woman they’re complaining about. 
    - If you do end up bringing it up to the woman that she may be actually being aggressive, approach the feedback like almost any other feedback: 
      - Start with reminding her of her good intentions
      - Point out some benefits of her communication style
      - Move on to your concern and the impact, ideally tying the impact to her goals. 
      - Then remind her that there are some double standards toward woman about being aggressive, so the feedback could be fair or unfair, but you just want to make her aware of the impressions she’s making. 
      - Then tell her you want to help her make those negative impressions go away.
  - Concerned she’ll take the feedback the wrong way
    - “Protective hesitation” means you  avoid raising potentially touchy issues with someone of another race or gender. 
      - Giving negative feedback is already uncomfortable - even more so when giving negative feedback to someone of a different race or gender.
    - When someone believes that they’re receiving negative feedback because the evaluator is biased, they’re more likely to dismiss it.
    - To help the feedback be heard, do two things: Invoke a higher standard, and then assure them that you believe they can meet that higher standard. 
      - This takes the feeling of “biased feedback” away and replaces it with the feeling that someone is truly on your side. 
  - What if she cries? 
    - Crying doesn’t mean that person is despondent. Crying can reflect any number of strong emotions. 
      - Many women interviewed that say they have cried, say that it was out of anger or powerlessness, not because they were hurt, or sad. 
    - If someone does start crying, do NOT continue as if nothing is happening - this is an invalidating behavior. Validate their emotions by not continuing, and by giving them some tissues. 
      - They’re probably concerned they’re going to look incompetent so it wouldn’t hurt to say something that validates that it’s okay to be emotional, or it’s okay to cry, etc. 
    - Once they’ve calmed down from the initial crying, ask what prompted the tears. 
      - It could be they didn’t like your feedback, but it also could be that they’re overwhelmed by other parts in their life and the pressure was building up. 
    - A strong show of emotions often reveals that the person is heavily invested in their work, but their investment is not being recognized. 
      - Ask if this is the case. If so, reassure the person that they have what it takes to make the improvements, and offer to brainstorm ideas of how to get where they want to get. 

### (Evaluation) Practice 5: Make Your Motto “No Surprises”

- The less frequent evaluation feedback sessions are, the more likely it is that there will be surprises, and surprises hurt… 
- Evaluations should be less frequent than coaching - coaching should be more immediate to the problem. 
  - ==Evaluation is intended to let the person know where they stand in comparison to their goals, or in comparison to the expectations.== 
- It’s a good idea to be giving an honest evaluation once every 3-6 months, not just once every year.
- Make sure, at the end of the evaluation feedback, that what you said, is what the other person heard by confirming with them what they heard. 
  - “It’s important to me that you’re set up for success. Based on what we’ve just discussed, what are your top three priorities for the next three months?”
- Don’t delay your evaluation to the end of the conversation right before the conversation is done. 
  - “You don’t want to be critical in the first three minutes… but you definitely don’t want to be critical in the last three minutes”
- ==Start by showing genuine appreciation for their hard work, and acknowledging the effort that they are putting into their work. And then transition into the evaluation.== 

### (Evaluation) Practice 6: Separate Your Observations from Your Story

- It’s human nature to tell stories. Therefor it’s very easy for us to see someone’s actions and generate a story to explain “why”. 
- ==Stories wreck evaluation conversations.== 
  - The story you whipped up in your head will almost always be wrong to some degree
    - If you let this story slip into your evaluation, the other person will focus on disputing the story you told and will view the evaluation as unfair. 
- When giving evaluations, ==stay away from stories - they will be disputed. Stick to observations - they can’t be disputed.== 
  - This makes sure that the conversation is geared toward finding a solution to the observations together instead of arguing a story. 
- Creating stories is a reflexive action we as humans take. Instead of being reflexive, we need to take a more enlightened approach. 
  - Instead of saying:  “You did/didn’t do X -> That happened because Y -> All of that is bad -> You need to change” try 
    ==“You did/didn’t do X -> Here’s the real impact -> I wonder what’s going on for you? -> What are the next steps?”==
  - ==Be curious about the reasoning, not convinced==. 
- There are 6 key steps to ensuring your evaluation conversation goes as well as it can. 
  - You’re giving bad news, so make sure to ==state your good intentions first before moving into the 6 key steps.== 
  - (1) State your observation
    - What did the person do/not do?
    - Strive to describe specific behaviors if the issue isn’t regarding a specific task or tasks they failed to do
      - Instead of “It seems like you think you’re too smart for the team” say “Did you realize you often roll your eyes when someone asks a question?”
  - (2) Describe the impact or result
    - There are two impacts that are worth mentioning: The impact their actions have on yourself/the team, and the impact their actions have on themselves and where they stand. 
    - When evaluating, you should address both impacts. 
      - When coaching, the impact on others is sufficient enough. 
  - (3) Learn More. 
    - ==When evaluating, or coaching, it requires a two-way conversation.== 
    - Asking “Can you help me understand what happened?” or something to that nature, can help you get an idea of their side, it can also help the other person feel heard and that the evaluation was fair, and also help create a more accurate plan for next steps. 
  - (4) Identify Next Steps
    - Unlike coaching sessions where it’s encouraged to get their proposal for next steps, when evaluating a bad behavior, you should be able to declare what you want to see happen next. Set the expectations
    - ==After setting your expectations, make sure you ask if there’s anything you can do to help make those happen.== 
    - Finally, address what can be done to avoid this problem in the future. 
      - “What do you propose we do differently next time?”
        “What can we do in the future to prevent this from happening again?”
        “In the future, what would you want to repeat and what would you want to change?”
    - ==The more you focus your feedback on the future instead of the past, the more likely the other person will take responsibility for change==
  - (5) Offer a reassurance
    - ==The other person needs to hear that you believe they can improve==, or meet the expectations, etc. 
    - The message you want to convey is “I know you can rise above this.”
  - (6) Thank Them. 
    - Having these difficult conversations isn’t easy for people. It can be very stressful. 
    - ==Make sure you thank them for having the conversation, and working with you to figure out a solution going forward==. 
- The above steps do not need to followed in that order every time, but it is important to hit each point. 
  - If the other person has a large ego, or you want to reduce their defensiveness, learning more (Step 3) is a good place to start. Then go back to steps 1 and 2.
- The story you created in your head for the person’s behavior is not forbidden from the evaluation conversation - it just has to be very distinct from the observations. 
  - It can be useful to share the story after the person explains their side of things (after step 3 from above), that way they can understand the impression their actions are giving people. 
- ==It’s important to provide supportive evaluation in events of failure==. That way they don’t take their failure too personally, and have it prevent them from trying in the future. 
- You also want to calm your own emotions before a tough conversation. When you’re triggered, your negative story has a higher chance of being wedged into the conversation. 
  - Take time to think about the story in your head - write it down if you need to - and then think of some questions regarding the situation or the person you don’t know the answer to (Honest, open questions).
