# Section 1: The Secret to Reaching Anyone



## 1) Who’s Holding You Hostage

- If you confront someone with purely logic and facts, or volume and anger in an attempt to convince them to listen to you, you’ll likely be shot down.
- Getting someone on your side all comes down to going through the motions (or phases) of the persuasion cycle
  1. “Resisting” => “Listening”
  2. “Listening” => “Considering”
  3. “Considering” => “Willing to Do”
  4. “Willing to Do” => “Doing”
  5. “Doing” => “Glad They Did Do”
  6. “Glad They Did Do” => “Continuing to Do”
- We may all be unique and different, but our brains all work in a similar manner - that’s why this book’s techniques work so well across the board.

## 2) A little Science: How the Brain Goes from “No” to “Yes”



- Your brain is made of three parts
  1. Inner Brain (Your Primal Brain) - In charge of simple survival mode: Fight or Flight. Not a lot of thinking comes from here. 
  2. Middle Brain (Your Mammal Brain) - In charge of extreme emotions: Love, Joy, Hate, etc. 
  3. Outer Brain (Your Primate Brain) - In charge of logic and decision making
- These three parts of your brains are a result of evolution, and are “Layered” on each other, similar to the rings of a tree. 
- When communicating with someone, you don’t want to be talking to the inner or middle brain. You need to be talking to the outer brain.
  - But First, you have to get them there. 
- Amygdala Hijack occurs when someone get’s overly emotional or stressed out. 
  - This state of mind throws things like logical processing and emotional intelligence out the window.
- Once you’re talking to someone who’s amygdala has been hijacked, you’re wasting your time. 
  - Preventing someone from being hijacked is easier than convincing them to start thinking logically again.  
- We have neurons that fire when watching others do or feel something. These neurons are our mirroring (or empathy) neurons.
  - These neurons fire off when our brains are putting ourselves in the position of the other person or thing.
- These mirror neurons are the reason we get emotional when someone compliments us, or when happy things are being done to us.
  - The average person lives in a “deficit” of feeling mirrored, or understood. 
    - We are constantly mirroring the world and people around us, and each time we do, it creates a tiny sense of desire for the mirroring to be reciprocated. When it’s not, we get further and further into a deficit. 
  - When someone mirrors us, or we feel “felt”, then it’s typically responded to by feeling relieved. 
- When communicating with people, it’s very important and effective to mirror other people, to express that you’re understanding how they feel or what they’re going through.
