# Section 1: The Secret to Reaching Anyone



## 1) Who’s Holding You Hostage

- If you confront someone with purely logic and facts, or volume and anger in an attempt to convince them to listen to you, you’ll likely be shot down.
- Getting someone on your side all comes down to going through the motions (or phases) of the persuasion cycle
  1. “Resisting” => “Listening”
  2. “Listening” => “Considering”
  3. “Considering” => “Willing to Do”
  4. “Willing to Do” => “Doing”
  5. “Doing” => “Glad They Did Do”
  6. “Glad They Did Do” => “Continuing to Do”
- We may all be unique and different, but our brains all work in a similar manner - that’s why this book’s techniques work so well across the board.

## 2) A little Science: How the Brain Goes from “No” to “Yes”



Your brain is made of three parts

1. Inner Brain (Your Primal Brain) - In charge of simple survival mode: Fight or Flight. Not a lot of thinking comes from here. 
2. Middle Brain (Your Mammal Brain) - In charge of extreme emotions: Love, Joy, Hate, etc. 
3. Outer Brain (Your Primate Brain) - In charge of logic and decision making

These three parts of your brains are a result of evolution, and are “Layered” on each other, similar to the rings of a tree. 

When communicating with someone, you don’t want to be talking to the inner or middle brain. You need to be talking to the outer brain.

- But First, you have to get them there. 

Amygdala Hijack occurs when someone get’s overly emotional or stressed out. 

- This state of mind throws things like logical processing and emotional intelligence out the window.

Once you’re talking to someone who’s amygdala has been hijacked, you’re wasting your time. 

- Preventing someone from being hijacked is easier than convincing them to start thinking logically again.  

We have neurons that fire when watching others do or feel something. These neurons are our mirroring (or empathy) neurons.

- These neurons fire off when our brains are putting ourselves in the position of the other person or thing.

These mirror neurons are the reason we get emotional when someone compliments us, or when happy things are being done to us.

- The average person lives in a “deficit” of feeling mirrored, or understood. 
  - We are constantly mirroring the world and people around us, and each time we do, it creates a tiny sense of desire for the mirroring to be reciprocated. When it’s not, we get further and further into a deficit. 
- When someone mirrors us, or we feel “felt”, then it’s typically responded to by feeling relieved. 

When communicating with people, it’s very important and effective to mirror other people, to express that you’re understanding how they feel or what they’re going through.

## 3) Move Yourself From “Oh F#@&” to “Ok”

You have to start any conversation by first making sure that you are under control of yourself. 

People are more receptive to you if you have control of yourself 

- Just like we’re less receptive to someone who is yelling, or crying, or in hysteria. 

Collecting yourself, and starting to think intelligently is something that comes naturally to us - we’re all able to do it. It just takes too long. 

- Instead of gathering your thoughts and thinking things through logically within a couple of hours, we need to be able to do that within minutes. 
- We need to go from Reptile Brain to Mammal Brain to Human Brain within a couple of minutes in order to have control over a situation. 
  - This is easier said than done - but possible, and trainable. 

Even though a “crisis” can be many different things - tiny to very large problems, our brain treats them all roughly the same, and therefore, we have steps or stages that we go through. This is the “Oh F#@&” to “OK” Process

- The Reaction Phase (“Oh F#@&”)
  - Oh what the hell, this is a disaster, there’s no fixing this, I’m done for.
- The Release Phase (“Oh God”)
  - This is a giant mess and I’m going to be stuck cleaning it up.
- The Re-Center Phase (“Oh Jeez”)
  - This is a mess, but I can clean it up - it’s not going to be fun.
- The Refocus phase (“Oh Well”)
  - I’m not going to let this ruin my career/day/week/relationship. Here’s what I need to do in order to fix this
- The Reengage phase (“Ok”)
  - I’m Ready to fix this.

Putting words to the emotions that you’re feeling in each stage is very important to being able to calm yourself down. 

- Either silently or out loud, allow yourself to identify or describe how you’re feeling.

==When you go from “Oh F#@&” to “Ok” you go from being fixated on the way you are convinced the would should or shouldn’t be, but never will be, to being ready to deal with the world the way it is.==

#### Practice the “OH F#@&” to “Ok” Speed Drill

Reaction => 

- Do NOT Deny that you’re feeling these intense emotions. 
- Acknowledge that you’re feeling them. 
- Do NOT Talk to anyone else while you’re in this phase. Your only priority should be getting out of this phase. 

=> Release => 

- Close your eyes, and breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. 
- Do this as many times as you need to release your emotions. 

=> Re-Center => 

- Keep breathing in and out slowly 
- May help to think/mutter the phases of the “Oh F#@&” to “Ok” process

=> Refocus => 

- Start to think of what you can do to control the damage and make the most of the situation

=> Reengage  

- Open your eyes, and start doing the actions you thought of.

## 4) Rewire Yourself to Listen

Our brains learn new things by building off of old knowledge. 

- Learn to walk after crawling
- Learn to type effectively after slowly pecking at the keys while staring at the keyboard. 

We are very inclined to make “gut-feeling” decisions about who a person is, what they’re like, based off our first impression. 

- These characteristics, this story can very often be false. 
- Once this story is built, this person we “created” in our mind, will be perceived like this by you from that point on. 
- These judgements change how we look at, talk to, and listen to that person. 

Our first impressions of people are built off of 5 key things

1. Gender
2. Generation (age)
3. Nationality
4. Education
5. Emotionality 

- These five things are in order because we notice the first three right away, then typically education level, and then feel the person’s level of emotionality

The reason we make these rigid decisions about people based solely off first impressions is because it’s easiest. 

- It takes a lot of effort for our brain to analyze every detail about every person we see or interact with

In order to reduce how much these first impressions influence our long term interactions or perception of a person, we must think about what we’re thinking. 

- Instead of just having these first impressions, after having them, think about what conclusions you just came up with.

==In order to hope for an open line of communication - you first must provide an open mind to the conversation.==

#### Practicing Being more Open-Minded

- Think of a person that is a problem person to you - slacking, irritating, or just someone that rubs you the wrong way. 
- Now think of 5 hypothetical reasons for their behavior. 
- For each behavior thought of - imagine how you would feel about that person had that situation been real.
